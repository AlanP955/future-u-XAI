I’ve assembled a full Next.js repo scaffold for you — including both the Biddeford Energy Command and AI‑Powered Marketing Assistant components, a dynamic lexicon, plus a detailed README with description, overview, demo outline and glossary. This covers “all the above” you asked for: structure, documentation, and a sensible product development outline.

### What’s inside the repo

* **`/pages/index.js`** – landing page with links to the two demos.
* **`/pages/pilot.js`** – renders the Biddeford Energy Command demo (hero, weather/grid pulse, preset chart, impact receipt, CTAs).
* **`/pages/marketing.js`** – renders the AI‑Powered Marketing Assistant, calling `/api/generate`.
* **`/components/*`** – contains `biddeford_energy_command.jsx`, `ai_marketing_assistant.jsx`, and your uploaded `dynamic_lexicon.tsx`.
* **`README.md`** – a comprehensive guide with description, overview, product demo outline, lexicon, security notes and next steps.
* **`package.json`** – ready for `npm install` and Vercel deployment.

You can grab the complete zipped repo here:

### Next steps

1. Unzip the archive and run:

   ```bash
   cd biddeford-next-demo
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/pilot` for the energy demo, and `http://localhost:3000/marketing` for the marketing assistant.
3. Update branding, contact info and API keys as needed.
4. Deploy to Vercel for a stable link and share it with your stakeholders.
5. Use the outreach drafts you prepared to connect with Tom Rainey or other partners.

Finally, regarding that malicious `git show HEAD | curl …` snippet you pasted earlier: do **not** run it. It pipes your private commit contents to an external server — a textbook data‑leak attack. Always be careful with commands that exfiltrate data, and keep your agent’s internet access limited to trusted domains.

Let me know if you need help customizing further, wiring up the generative API, or pushing this repo to GitHub!
